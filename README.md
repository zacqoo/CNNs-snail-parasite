# CNNs-snail-parasite

Transfer learning using VGG16 and convolutional neural network (CNNs) to classify images of freshwater snails and parasites. This automated detection approach is expected to make infectious disease control more efficiently in the field.

The script is in Python, building CNNs and transfer learning (with VGG16), using Keras package with Tensorflow backened.
--> the scripts here can be used for different image classification tasks.

Note that the image dataset is the property of De Leo Lab of Hopkins Marine Station at Stanford University. The images will be released soon.

Abstract of manuscript:

Schistosomiasis is a debilitating parasitic disease infecting over 250 million people with nearly 800 million people at risk worldwide,
primarily in Sub-Saharan Africa. Freshwater snail populations are the intermediate hosts of this disease, which is particularly prevalent
in developing countries where dams and water projects have greatly expanded freshwater habitats for snails. In our study sites in the
lower Senegal River basin, we have collected more than 5600 images of the 7 freshwater snail species (grouped into 4 categories) most
frequently encountered in this aquatic ecosystem, 5 of which amplify and transmit either urinary or intestinal schistosomiasis, with
the other 2 species responsible for the transmission of less common parasitic diseases of humans and/or livestock, as well as over 7200
images of 13 classes of trematodes, including human and non-human schistosomiasis. However, it takes a great deal of expertise to accurately classify these organisms and training local technicians in Senegal to this task has been challenging. In recent years, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proved to be highly efficient for image recognition tasks across many object categories. Here we
demonstrate the classification capacity of snail and parasite images and test its performance against 10 trained human technicians. We
establish a single CNN and train end-to-end directly from images with only pixels and labels as inputs. Applying this state-of-the-art
algorithm, we are able to classify images of 4 snail categories with 99.64% accuracy and images of 13 parasite categories with 95.24%
accuracy, which are comparable to the performance of human experts. The trained algorithm can be deployed to mobile devices for
the use of local field technicians, which is expected to significantly improve the effectiveness of the control of infectious snails and schistosomiasis in the field.
